# FastPrimeTest
Code made to get the highest speed possible calculating big prime numbers. The biggest problem of the code is the number limit to 64 bits longer, i tried everything but nothing was possible to get the number bigger. If you can help improve the code speed or the number limit, please, do a pull request.
